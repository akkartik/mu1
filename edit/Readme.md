Environment for learning programming using Mu: http://akkartik.name/post/mu

Run it from the `mu` directory:

  ```shell
  $ ./mu edit
  ```

This will load all the `.mu` files in this directory and then run the editor.
Press ctrl-c to quit. Press F4 to save your work (if a lesson/ directory
exists) and to run the contents of the sandbox editor on the right.

You can also run the tests for the environment:

  ```shell
  $ ./mu test edit
  ```

You can also load the files more explicitly by enumerating them all (in order):

  ```shell
  $  ./mu edit/*.mu
  ```

This is handy if you want to play with simpler versions of the editor that are
easier to understand. Stop loading at any layer to run with a subset of
features:

  ```shell
  $ ./mu edit/001*.mu edit/002*.mu  # run a simple editor rather than the full environment
  ```
